### HTML5

### CSS3
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

## Functionality
What is the **purpose** of this project? I learned Html5 and Css3 some time ago, and to refresh my knowledge I decided to make a simple project to help me remember, there you have one of the reasons why this page is probably poorly done and therefore has bad practices, sorry for that. Anyway, take it as **a free day project elaborated by this guy.** Thanks for reading.
